# Storyline
## In a parallel universe, Amanda embarks on a journey to find a team of highly skilled software engineers for her startup. Mr. Robot and Silicon Valley were two of Amanda's favorite television series. But in this universe, Elliot Alderson works for the government, and Richard Hendricks does not destroy Pied Piper in the end. A world where a few lines of code could solve problems or create menace. She was intrigued when she got a chance to enroll in her first programming class. Unlike some other girls from her class, she was convinced that this was the path she wanted to take. During college, she completed multiple internships in Machine Learning, enhancing her skills and expertise. After her college, with a mission to build custom software for their clients, she started Amanda Coding LLC. She wants to build a team of highly skilled software engineers. For this, she wants to find teammates who meet all the technical skills as per the job requirement. 

# Problem Statement
## While researching, she found a raw dataset of over 30k datapoints (Raw_Skills_Dataset.csv) which contain technical skills and a lot of jargon mixed in. Can you help her develop a code that can clean this dataset and extract Technical (Hard) skills?
